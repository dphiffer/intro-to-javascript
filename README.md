# Intro to JavaScript

This afternoon I gave a very short introduction to computer programming at [Trade School](http://tradeschool.ourgoods.org/). I focused on JavaScript as a language to start with, mainly because there's essentially nothing to install and there are many practical uses to knowing a little JS.

There are four main things here:

* `intro-to-javascript.key` - my original Keynote slides (probably needs [Vista Slab](http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=209) font to look right)
* `hello-world.html` - exactly what it sounds like
* `hide-content.html` - a simple MooTools `fade` example
* `slide-show.html` - a more fully-fledged slide show example
